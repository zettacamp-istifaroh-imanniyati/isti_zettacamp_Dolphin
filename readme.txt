TASK
Implement 9 cards which contain data of a popular item(smartphone, laptop, etc) . 3 x 3 with each row has 3 cards. With these conditions :  
Text Header : “Popular Products”
3 cards on the first row should have zero margin with the top element(which should be title) of the page.
3 cards on the second row should have 1 rem space between the first and last row.
3 cards on the third row should have zero margin with the bottom element(which should be footer) of the page.
Separate Styling of “Popular Product” into separate classes and combine them with multiple css classes. For example, Create class mb-1 for margin-bottom 1 rem, pt-1 for padding-top 1 rem, etc. Then combine them together to style an element.
Add 9 more cards, you can simply duplicate them. This time make the Text Header stick when the user scrolling down.
Create another page with 2 containers that has a list of items(use unordered list) in storage and a list of items sold. They are in different containers. Each of these containers is scrollable on their own. So when you scroll on a list of items in storage, it should not affect the list of items sold and vice versa.
